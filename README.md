# ⚙️ How It Works

Users join a shared room where they can:

* Write Python code
* Run code locally in their browser
* See other users' code update live
* Chat with everyone in the room

Unlike traditional online compilers, co-code.net does **not** execute Python on the server.

Instead, Python runs client-side using Pyodide.

This allows:

* Lower hosting costs
* Better scalability
* Reduced security risks
* Faster execution startup

The server mainly handles:

* Room management
* User synchronization
* Messaging
* Session/token handling

# ⚡ Performance Design

co-code.net avoids sending updates on every keystroke.

Instead:

1. Users are marked as "dirty" when their code changes
2. The server periodically syncs only changed users
3. Rooms without changes are skipped entirely

This helps reduce:

* Network spam
* Socket event overload
* Server usage
* Unnecessary updates

# 🔒 Security

Current protections include:

* HTTPS deployment
* Content Security Policy (CSP)
* Input validation
* Token-based session

# ➕ Potential features

Things I am thinking of adding later on (not soon):

* Patch updating. Optimization problem is that code is currently updated via whole strings instead of only the part of code that actually changed. Patch updating will allow udpates to only include characters that have changed or have beenn deleted, increasing performance durastically and lowering the size of data being held by the server and emitted into sockets.
* Multiple servers. Depending on how big co-code.net becomes, having a multi-server system will definetely be considered for both faster connection in differing regions and scalability.
